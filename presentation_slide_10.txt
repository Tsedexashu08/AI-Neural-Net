# Slide 10: Evaluation - Per-Class Performance

**(Show the `per_class_metrics.png` bar chart)**

**Key Observations:**
*   Excellent performance on majority classes like 'Minor' and 'PDO'.
*   Lower F1-scores for minority classes like 'Fatal' and 'POD'.
*   This highlights the impact of class imbalance on the model's performance.

**Slide Notes:**

*   This bar chart shows the precision, recall, and F1-score for each individual accident type.
*   As we saw in the confusion matrix, the model performs exceptionally well on the majority classes, which have a large number of examples in the dataset.
*   However, for the minority classes, the performance is not as strong. For example, the 'Fatal' class has a lower F1-score.
*   This is a classic example of the challenge of working with imbalanced datasets. The model is biased towards the majority classes because it has seen many more examples of them during training.
*   Improving the performance on these minority classes is a key area for future work.
