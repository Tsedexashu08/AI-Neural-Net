# Slide 2: Project Overview

**Objective:**
To build, train, and evaluate a neural network to classify the severity of vehicle accidents based on the `CrashData.xlsx` dataset.

**Agenda:**
1.  **Data Understanding:** A quick look at the data.
2.  **Data Preparation:** How the data was cleaned and prepared.
3.  **Model Architecture:** The design of our neural network.
4.  **Training & Evaluation:** How the model was trained and how it performed.
5.  **Conclusion:** Key takeaways and future work.

**Slide Notes:**

*   The main goal of this project is to create a model that can accurately predict the type of accident, which could be useful for various purposes, such as resource allocation for emergency services.
*   In this presentation, we will follow a structured agenda. We will start by understanding the data, then move on to how we prepared it for the model. After that, we will look at the model's architecture and its performance. Finally, we will conclude with a summary and some ideas for future work.
*   I will be highlighting the key findings and decisions made at each step of the process.
