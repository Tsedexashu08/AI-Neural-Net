**Key Takeaways:**
*   **Feature Distributions:** Revealed a wide range of values and distributions for various features.
*   **Correlations:** The heatmap shows the relationships between numeric features. A strong positive correlation (0.63) was found between `Driver age` and `Driver experiance(years)`.

**Slide Notes:**

*   To further understand our data, we visualized the distributions of our features and the correlations between them.
*   The feature distributions on the left gave us insights into the characteristics of each feature, such as the age of the drivers or the year of service of the vehicles.
*   The correlation heatmap on the right helped us identify relationships between numeric variables. For example, as expected, there is a strong positive correlation between a driver's age and their years of experience.
*   These analyses were vital for our data preparation and feature engineering decisions.
