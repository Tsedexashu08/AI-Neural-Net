**Slide Notes:**

*   Now for the moment of truth: how did our model perform on data it has never seen before?
*   We evaluated our final model on the test set, and the results were very encouraging.
*   We achieved an overall accuracy of 96.7%, which means our model correctly predicted the accident type for the vast majority of cases.
*   The weighted F1-score, precision, and recall are all around 96.6% and 96.7%, which are excellent scores and indicate that the model is both precise and robust.
*   These high-level metrics give us confidence that our model is effective.
